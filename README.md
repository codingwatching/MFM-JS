# MFM-JS (v2)

## Movable Feast Machine simulator built in JavaScript

---

### The idea here is not to port MFM to JavaScript, but instead simulate it enough and provide an environment that is easy to quickly get hands-on with robust-first programming.

---

Prerequisites

- nodejs 18+ (_I use nvm to easily manage and upgrade node versions_) (https://nodejs.org)
- an IDE like VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install

- git clone https://github.com/walpolea/MFM-JS.git
- `cd MFM-JS/mfm-js`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- the library builds to `/mfm-js/dist`
- also serve up `index.html` with `npm run dev` to watch chaanges as you build things.
- note that the renderers are no longer bundled with the main library
