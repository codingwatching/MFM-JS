# MFM-JS (v2)

## Movable Feast Machine simulator built in JavaScript

---

### The idea here is not to port MFM to JavaScript, but instead simulate it enough and provide an environment that is easy to quickly get hands-on with robust-first programming.

Prerequisites

- nodejs 14+ (_I use nvm to easily manage and upgrade node versions_) (https://nodejs.org)
- an IDE like VS Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Install

- git clone https://github.com/walpolea/MFM-JS.git
- `cd MFM-JS`
- `npm install`
- `npm run build`
- serve up `public/index.html` to view in browser
  - you can `npm install -g serve`
  - and then `serve ./public`
  - or even `npx serve ./public`
